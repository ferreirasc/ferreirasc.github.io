      <title>Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE) - Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took the amazing &amp;ldquo;Windows Red Team Lab&amp;rdquo; course from PentesterAcademy, a prerequisite course for the Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE) certification. I must confess that I had my eye on this course for some time, mainly due to the topics covered in its content (anyone who knows me knows how much I like Active Directory exploitation and everything it involves ;). As I was a little tired of the HackTheBox boxes routine, I decided it would be a good time to start the lab and learn new AD stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this review is just to pass on a little of the experience I had in the lab and in the exam. Obviously, I have no intention of providing spoilers, lab walkthrough nor anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
